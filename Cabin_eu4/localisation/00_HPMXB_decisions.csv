jules_ferry_laws_title;The Jules Ferry Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jules_ferry_laws_desc;French education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems, the first being a secondary school system and the second a primary school system. However, in each of these systems, the Catholic Church provided an alternative to secular schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France. \n\nThe Jules Ferry Laws were a set of French Laws which established free education, then mandatory and laic (secular) education. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, was widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l'école républicaine). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
