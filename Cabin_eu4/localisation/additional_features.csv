enable_crimeamod_subsidies_title;Enable Crimeamod Style Subsidies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enable_crimeamod_subsidies_desc;Crimeamod is a mod for Victoria 2 which has very good AI, one given reason for this is, in the mod AI countries can't subsidize their unprofitable factories, which the AI has a tendancy to expand until it bankrupts itself. The AI seems to use the Extra money to have a bigger military, so use this option if you want to try a AI which will prioritize military spending. From my testing in the very late game industry tends to concentrate into the top industrial powers and other AI's can struggle to break into the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99930;Splendid Isolation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99930;It is the duty of the Government of this country, placed as it is with regard to geographical position, to keep itself upon terms of goodwill with all surrounding nations, but not to entangle itself with any single or monopolising alliance with any one of them, above all to endeavour not to interfere needlessly and vexatiously with the internal affairs of any foreign country. - Lord Edward Stanley, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. \n\nThe policy of 'splendid isolation' was characterised by Britain's reluctance to enter into permanent European alliances or commitments with the other great powers. During the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
