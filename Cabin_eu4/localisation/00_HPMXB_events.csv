EVTDESC8016634;The Caribbean is a diverse cluster of islands colonized by a wide array of nations and people, some who arrived more willing than others. Never the less, the United States is gifting upon those many islands an opportunity to be something greater. Although now that all the Antilles are under one flag, the question remains where shall the capital be. Should it be in the oldest city in the Caribbean, Havana, or a more central location like Jamaica. The Haitians share our revolutionary spirit, although perhaps to an extreme that not everyone is comfortable with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5853546;When American ships sailed into various ports in Alaska to announce to the local population their liberation into American hands, most were either unware there was a war or apathetic towards the regime change. Although the most logical action would be to incorporate Alaska as a territory of the United States, some argue this would be imperialistic in nature and infringe upon the rights of population in Alaska. The majority Inuit population shows no interest in state building, and the small European Alaskan population is so small that it would not take long for American settlers to outnumber them. Although as barren as the land is, it would be a harmless yet prestigious display of good will to give it independence, under tight American supervision of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7391609;The recent invasion of the Mexican Empire by the United States has alarmed many here in Brazil. There are rumors in the royal court that it will be only a matter of time before the United States strikes south and attempts to oust Brazilian monarchy. None this is helped by the fact that liberals and other pro-republic factions have been inspired by the United States recent revolutionary fervor. It might be for the best if the Brazilian royal family were to slip away to safety in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9452276;The monarchy of Brazil has fled Rio, allowing pro-democracy forces to seize the capital and transform the country into a republic. It would seem are ideals of liberty our spreading throughout the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3886062;Brazilâ€™s transition into a republic has not been as stable as some have hoped. There are frequent clashes in the streets between conservatives and liberals which end in large amount of bloodshed by both sides. Something must be done, and those on the right are demanding the military step in to secure order and centralize the state. This might grant some stability, but it would be a betrayal to the ideas of democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2791898;In attempt to ensure stability, a military strongman in Brazil has taken emergency measures and in doing so severely restricted the democratic rights guaranteed by the previous government. Many in the United States view this recent regime change as something just as tyrannical if not more so than the monarchy that preceded the revolution. There are some the United States that are tired of frequently interfering in the affairs of other American countries. It might be for the best to simply recognize the new government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1595471;When the United States caught wind of the military seizing power, they almost immediately pressured the new government to step down and allow for elections. Although the United States is supposed to protect the New World not invade it, Brazil must be cautious in how it reacts to our Anglo neighbors to the north. It would be foolish to go head to head with the United States, but cowardly to simply bend to their wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2931608;The military government has refused to allow for free and open elections. If we want democracy to prevail in Brazil, we may have to invade. An unpopular idea, but a necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1225875;The United States has demanded that we join the newly formed Andes Republic. The obvious choice is to refuse as Chile is a sovereign state. But then again, we might not want to anger the American eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7859305;Chile has refused to join the Andes Republic on the principle of sovereignty and what not. For the good of the New World and for the stability of South America, the obvious choice is to send a democratic expedition to Chile. Although there are many who would see this as gross violation of Chilean rights, everything the United States does is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3552310;Although Panama is technically under the jurisdiction of the Colombians, there are many on the isthmus who would rather join the Federal Republic in Central America. The United States is in a position to peacefully resolve the issue to prevent conflict from erupting and settle for good who rules Panama. Panama can either join the FRCA, stay under the control of Gran Colombia, or perhaps dividing the isthmus between the two is a suitable compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC7680756;Due to war, civil unrest, and the overall lost of democratic morals and republican values, the United States of America is no longer the shining light of liberty that it once was. The collapse of American institutions and decline of American power means the United States is no longer able to manage its hegemonic grip over the New World. Uncertainty strikes the Americas and the future of the democratic states we have created remains unstable without American backing. Once again, the New World will be open to exploitation by foreign tyrants. Perhaps one day the United States will be able to recover its dignity, but that day is a long way off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2667604;Due to a wide array of factors, both external and internal, the United States is no longer the hegemony it once claimed to be. The New World is now in disarray as American support to North and South American states is being cut and relations severed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1602682;Although New England serves only as a colloquial name to the collection small states of the North East, there are many patriots, although some would call them radicals, who believe that in this new era of revolution it is inappropriate bordering on treasonous for a region of this great nation to bear the same name as its former oppressors. As such, these devoted men of liberty wish to rename it to something more befitting of a democratic society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72749;There seems to be no end to American aggression. First, they seize Oregon, and now their so called Manifest Destiny calls for all the Great White North to be in their hands. Diplomacy with these fanatics is useless and who knows what else those war hawks in Washington are planning. To secure the Canadian frontier from the American menace, all colonial dominions must come under direct rule from London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72748;All is quiet on the Northern Frontier as the blood of the fallen stains red the snow of Canada. John Quincy Adam once said the United States does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy, and yet how foolish are we for bringing the beast to our very doorstep. The War Hawks in Washington promised to bring the American people to glory, but instead have brought disaster upon this great nation. Not only does Canada remain under British rule, but now several of the United States northern territories along with our gains from the Oregon Wars have been lost. To make matters worse, the New England states including New York have become another puppet state of the imperial crown. Riots against the statesman in the District Colombia for their ignorance are bound to break out. This will be a day that forever haunts the American spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72740;What an embarrassing day for Empire of Great Britain. Truly we are the laughing stock of Europe for being beaten so badly by our former subjects. Not only has America seized everything north of the 50th Parallel, but they have also taken all British territories in the Caribbean and South America. The Treaty of Philadelphia has also resulted British spheres of influenced in the New World being expelled and replaced with the United States. The British crown has been dented by this defeat and our international reputation is severely stained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72738;After the Crusade for Canada, great swaths of lands ca me under American control. Both Anglo and French Canadians were liberated thanks the Treaty of Philadelphia. France has recently offered to purchase Quebec from us citing cultural bonds and the need to undo the wrongs of the British Empire done against French Canadians. Some in Washington are in favor of such a deal believing that America is an Anglo nation that French Canadians could never integrate in. There is also the fact the French are currently offering a large sum in exchange for Quebec and America is always in need of more funds. Others argue it would be wrong to transfer Quebec to France without first ensuring French Canadians have a right to home rule even if France would not likely pay the full price currently on the table. Many are adamant that to sell American lands to European powers is an offence to the patriots who died for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC93744;While the French-Canadians share our colonial spirit and history, their culture and language is unique from the rest of Anglo Protestant nation. The question there for arises what is to be done with them? Should we attempt to integrate them, or would it be better off for them to have autonomy in the Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
